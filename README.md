# HaskellRecursionAndPattern
This program consists of 2 separate files. Hw9a.hs is full of functions written using recursion. Hw9b.hs is full of the same functions this time written using Pattern Matching and Guards.
##How to compile and run
>First you must install Haskell in your terminal. How to do this can be found on their website
**Terminal Commands**
Start Haskell
```
% ghci
```
Load in the file

```
Run a function from the file.                                           
This is done by writting the name of the function in the terminal followed by the values to pass in.
